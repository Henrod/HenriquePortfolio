		<p>Hello! My name is Henrique.</p></br>
		<p>I am a student of Computer and Software Engineering. The end of my graduation will be in December 2016.</p></br>

		<p>My interest in the Linux operating system, the Linux kernel and the GNU kernel has increased since then. I began to study its main commands Shell.</p></br>
